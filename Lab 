The code you provided is written in C++, not Dart. To compile and run it, you can use a C++ compiler like `g++`. Here's how you can do it:

1. Save the code in a file named `BankSim3000.cpp` (or any other name with a `.cpp` extension).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Run the following command to compile the code:
  ```bash
  g++ -o BankSim3000 BankSim3000.cpp
  ```
  This will create an executable file named `BankSim3000`.

4. Run the compiled program with:
  ```bash
  ./BankSim3000
  ```

If you encounter any errors during compilation, let me know, and I can help you debug them.
